# Module 5: Creating WCF Services

> Wherever you see a path to file starting at [repository root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
> e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06

# Lesson 2: Creating and Implementing a Contract

### Demonstration: Creating a WCF Service

1. On the Start menu, right click the **Visual Studio 2017** tile and select **Run as Administrator**.
2. In the **User Account Control** modal, click **Yes**.
3. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
4. Go to **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\20487C\Mod05\DemoFiles\CreatingWCFService\begin**.
5. Select the **CreatingWCFService.sln** file, and then click **Open**.
6. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Service** project, and then double-click **IHotelBookingService.cs**. This interface is the service contract, but it still has to be configured with **[ServiceContract]** and **[ServiceOperation]** attributes.
7. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **HotelBookingService.cs**. This class is the implementation of the service contract.
8. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **BookingResponse.cs**. This class is a data contract that is returned by the service operation **BookHotel**. It still has to be configured with the **[DataContract]** and **[DataMember]** attributes.
9. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, and then click **Reference**.
10. In the **Reference Manager - Service** dialog box, expand the **Assemblies** node in the left pane, and then click **Framework**.
11. Scroll down the assemblies list, point to the **System.Runtime.Serialization** assembly, and then select the check box next to the assembly name.
12. Scroll down the assemblies list some more, point to the **System.ServiceModel** assembly, and then select the check box next to the assembly name. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
13. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **IHotelBookingService.cs**.
14. Add the following **using** directive.

   ```cs
        using System.ServiceModel;
```
15. Add the **[ServiceContract]** attribute above the **IHotelBookingService** interface declaration.
16. Add the **[OperationContract]** attribute above the **BookHotel** method declaration.  

    These attributes mark the interface as a WCF service contract and expose the interface methods as service operations.
 
17. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
18. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **BookingResponse.cs**.
19. Add a **using** directive for the **System.Runtime.Serialization** namespace after the last **using** directive.
20. To the **BookingResponse** class declaration, add the **[DataContract]** attribute.
21. To each of the properties of the class, add the **[DataMember]** attribute.  

    These attributes define the classes as data contracts so that WCF can serialize/deserialize them appropriately.
    
22. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
23. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **Reservation.cs**.
24. To the **Reservation** class declaration, add the **[DataContract]** attribute.
25. To each of the properties of the class, add the **[DataMember]** attribute.
26. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
27. In Visual Studio 2017, press F5 to run the project. Check that the WCF Test Client opens, and the service project&#39;s tree in the left pane displays the **BookHotel()** operation node.
28. Double-click the operation **BookHotel**, locate the **HotelName** parameter in the **Request** section on the right, and enter**HotelA** in the **Value** column.
29. To make a request to the service, click **Invoke**.
30. If a security warning appears, click **OK**.
31. Check that the **Response** section displays the following:

    - BookingReference: **AR3254**
    - IsApproved: **True**

32. Close the WCF Test Client application.
33. Close Visual Studio 2017.

# Lesson 3: Configuring and Hosting WCF Services

### Demonstration: Configuring Endpoints in Code and in Configuration

1. On the Start menu, right click the **Visual Studio 2017** tile and select **Run as Administrator**.
2. In the **User Account Control** modal, click **Yes**.
3. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
4. Go to **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\20487C\Mod05\DemoFiles\DefineServiceEndpoints\begin**, select **DefineServiceEndpoints.sln**, and then click **Open**.
5. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **ServiceHost** project, and then double-click **App.config**.
6. Locate the **&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;** section group. In this section of the file, you define the base address, endpoints, and behaviors of the service.
7. To the **&lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;** element, add the following configuration:

```cs
    <behavior>
        <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="True"/>
    </behavior>
```  
   The service cannot be tested unless the service behavior has the **serviceMetadata** behavior.
8. To add base addresses, add the following configuration to the **&lt;service&gt;** element.

```cs
    <host>
        <baseAddresses>
            <add baseAddress="http://localhost:8733/" />
        </baseAddresses>
    </host>
```
9. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
10. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click **App.config**, and then click **Edit WCF Configuration**.
11. In the **Configuration** pane of the **Service Configuration Editor** window, expand the **HotelBooking.HotelBookingService** node,  right-click the **Endpoints** node, and then click **New Service Endpoint.**
12. In the **General** tab, enter the following information.

    - Address: **booking**
    - Binding: **basicHttpBinding**
    - Contract: **HotelBooking.IHotelBookingService**

13. On the **File** menu, click **Save**.
14. On the **File** menu, click **Exit**.
15. Return to **Visual Studio 2017**. If you receive a message saying that the **App.config** file has changed, click **Yes**.  

    You added a service endpoint that uses **basicHttpBinding**. This endpoint uses a relative address (**booking**). This is why the base addresses section is also required.
    
16. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **ServiceHost** project, click **Program.cs**.
17. After the initialization of the **ServiceHost**, add the following line of code to the **Main** method.

   ```cs
        host.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IHotelBookingService), new NetTcpBinding(), "booking");
```

   You added an endpoint that uses **NetTcpBinding**, with a relative address (**booking**).  
    
18. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.  
19. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **ServiceHost** project, and then click **Set as StartUp Project**.  
20. To run the project, press F5. If **Windows Security Alert** Window appears click **Allow access**.
21. Verify that the service is hosted in the console application.  
22. On the Start screen, click the **Developer Command Prompt for VS2017** tile.  
23. In the command prompt, type the following command and press Enter.  

   ```cs
        WcfTestClient  http://localhost:8733/
```
24. After the **WCF Test Client** tool opens, review the service and its endpoint. Notice that the service has two endpoints.
25. Under the TCP binding endpoint, double-click the method **BookHotel**.
26. In the parameter **HotelName** (under the **Value** column), enter the value **HotelA**.
27. To send the request to the service, click **Invoke**.
28. If a security warning appears, click **OK**.
29. Check that the **Response** section displays the following:

    - BookingReference: **AR3254**
    - IsApproved: **True**

30. In the left pane, right-click the **http://localhost:8733/** node, and then click **Copy Address**.
31. On the Start menu, click the **Microsoft Edge** icon, select all the text in the browser address bar, and press Ctrl+V to paste the metadata address you copied. Press Enter.
32. The page displays an explanation of how to consume the service from a client. Click **http://localhost:8733/?wsdl**, and then review the overall structure of the WSDL file.
33. Close the browser and the WCF Test Client window.
34. Return to Visual Studio 2017, press Shift+F5 to stop debugging, and then close Visual Studio 2017.

# Lesson 4: Consuming WCF Services

### Demonstration 1: Adding a Service Reference

1. On the Start menu, right click the **Visual Studio 2017** tile and select **Run as Administrator**.
2. In the **User Account Control** modal, click **Yes**.
3. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
4. Go to **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\20487C\Mod05\DemoFiles\AddingServiceReference\begin**.
5. Select the **AddServiceReference.sln** file, and then click **Open**.
6. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **ServiceHost** project and double-click **App.config**. **App.config** contains three service endpoints: one with **BasicHttpBinding**, one with **NetTcpBinding**, and one MEX endpoint. The service must have the **ServiceMetadata** behavior before you can add a service reference with Visual Studio 2012.
7. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **ServiceHost** project, and then click **Set as StartUp Project**.
8. To start the service host without debugging, press Ctrl+F5.
9. Wait for the service host console to display the **Service Hosted Successfully!** message.
10. Return to Visual Studio 2017. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **ServiceClient** project, right-click **Service References**, and then click **Add Service Reference**.
11. In the **Add Service Reference** dialog box, in the **Address** box, enter **http://localhost:8733/HotelBooking**,  and then click  **Go**.
12. Wait for the service information to download. In the **Namespace** box, enter **HotelBooking**, and then click **OK**. The service proxy class and the data contract classes are added under the **HotelBooking** namespace.
13. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **ServiceClient** project, and double-click the **app.config** file. Point out the new **&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;** section group that Visual Studio added to the file. The configuration contains the client endpoints and binding configuration.
14. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **ServiceClient** project, double-click **Program.cs**.
15. Select the code that appears in comments, click the **Edit** menu, point to **Advanced**, and then click **Uncomment Selection**.  
    
    The code in the **Main** method initializes a new instance of the generated service proxy **HotelBooking.HotelBookingServiceClient.** The generated proxy implements the service contract interface and, therefore, you can use it to start the service methods as if it was a local object.

16. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
17. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click **ServiceClient**, point to **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance**.  

    Wait until the console application starts and displays the following message: &quot;Booking response: Approved, booking reference: AR3254&quot;.
    
18. To close the client console application, press Enter.
19. Switch to the service console application window, and press Enter to shut down the service.
20. Close Visual Studio 2017.

### Demonstration 2: Using Channel Factories

1. On the Start menu, right click the **Visual Studio 2017** tile and select **Run as Administrator**.
2. In the **User Account Control** modal, click **Yes**.
3. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
4. Go to **[Repository root]\Allfiles\20487C\Mod05\DemoFiles\UsingChannelFactory\begin**.
5. Select the **UsingChannelFactory.sln** file, and then click **Open**.
6. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **ServiceHost** project, and then double-click **App.config**. The **App.config** file contains three service endpoints: one with **BasicHttpBinding**, one with **NetTcpBinding**, and one MEX endpoint.
7. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **ServiceClient** project, point to **Add**, and then click **Reference**.
8. In the left pane of the **Reference Manager** dialog box, expand the **Solution** node, and then click **Projects**.
9. In the projects list, point to **Common**, and then select the check box next to the project name.
10. In the left pane, expand the **Assemblies** node, and then click **Framework**. Scroll down the assemblies list, point to the  **System.ServiceModel** assembly, select the check box next to the assembly name, and then click **OK**.  

    The reference was added to gain access to the service and data contracts and to the WCF client libraries.
    
11. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **ServiceClient** project and double-click **Program.cs**.
12. To the **using** section at the top of the file, add the following **using** directives.

   ```cs
        using HotelBooking;
        using System.ServiceModel;
```
13. At the beginning of the **Main** method, add the following lines of code before the commented code.

   ```cs
        ChannelFactory<IHotelBookingService> serviceFactory =
            new ChannelFactory<IHotelBookingService>
                (new BasicHttpBinding(),
                "http://localhost:8733/HotelBooking/HotelBookingHttp");
                
        IHotelBookingService proxy = serviceFactory.CreateChannel();
   ```  
    
   The service contract interface is passed as a generic type parameter to the **ChannelFactory&lt;T&gt;** generic class. 
   
14. Select the code that appears in comments, click the **Edit** menu, point to **Advanced**, and then click **Uncomment Selection**.  
15. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.  
16. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **ServiceHost** project, and then click **Set as StartUp Project**.  
17. To start the service host without debugging, press Ctrl+F5.  
18. Wait for the service host console to display the **Service Hosted Successfully!** message.  
19. Return to Visual Studio 2017. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **ServiceClient** project, and then click **Set as StartUp Project**.  
20. To start the client without debugging, press Ctrl+F5.  
21. Wait until the console application starts and displays the **Booking response: Approved, booking reference: AR3254** message.  
22. Close both console applications and Visual Studio 2017.
