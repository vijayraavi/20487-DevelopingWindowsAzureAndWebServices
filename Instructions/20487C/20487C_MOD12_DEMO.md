#### Demonstration Steps

### Build and Publish  **ScalableAzureApp Project** by using **Visual Studio 2017**

 1. Open Visual Studio 2017.
 2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
 3. Go to **[repositoryroot]\Allfiles\20487C\Mod12\DemoFiles\ScallingAppServices**.

 5. In Visual Studio 2017, in **Solution Explorer**, expand the **ScalableAzureApp** project, and then click **Web.config**.
 6. In **Web.config**, search for **key="RedisConnectionString"** and replace its value with the connection string you saved when you configured **Redis Cache**. It should look something like the following code: 

```xml
       <appSettings>
         <add key="ReidsConnectionString" value="*place the connection string here*" />
       </appSettings>
```

 7. In Visual Studio 2017, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **ScalableAzureApp** project, and then click **Publish**.
 8. In the **Publish**, from the listed targets, click the **Create new** profile, select the **Import** profile, and then click **Publish**. This will open **File Explorer**. Go to the folder where you saved the **Publish** profile and open it.
 9. Click the **Publish** option and wait for the web application to be deployed. When deployment is complete your web app should open in the browser.
