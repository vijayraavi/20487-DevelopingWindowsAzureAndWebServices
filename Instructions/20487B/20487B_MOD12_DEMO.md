  ```cs
		using Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching;
```
18. Locate the comment _// TODO: Place cache initialization here_, and then place the following code after it:

  ```cs
		DataCacheFactory cacheFactory = new DataCacheFactory();
        DataCache cache = cacheFactory.GetDefaultCache();
```
19. Locate the comment _// TODO: Find the location entity in the cache_, and then place the following code after it:

  ```cs
		string cacheKey = "location_" + id.ToString();
        location = cache.Get(cacheKey) as Location;
```
20. Add the following code between the _comment // TODO: Add the location to the cache_ and the end of the using statement:

  ```cs
		cache.Put(cacheKey, location);
```

28. Press F5 to continue running the application and display the browser. Verify you see the XML of the location entity.
29. Press F5 to refresh the page. Visual Studio 2012 opens and stops on the breakpoint.
30. Press F10 several times, until you reach the **if** statement.
31. Hover over the **location** object, and then show students that its value is set to a location entity.
